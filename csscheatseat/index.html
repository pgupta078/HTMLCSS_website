                    There are three reasons why I prefer jogging to other sports. One
                    reason is that jogging is a cheap sport. I can practise it anywhere
                    at any time with no need for a ball or any other equipment. Another
                    reason why I prefer jogging is that it is friendly to my heart. I
                    don’t have to exhaust myself or do excessive efforts while jogging.
                    Finally, I prefer this sport because it is safe. It isn’t as risky
                    as other sports like gymnastics, racing or horseback riding. For all
                    these reasons, I consider jogging the best sport of all.
